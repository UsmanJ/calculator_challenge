Maths Game
======================

Synopsis
-----

This is my first C# project. It is a maths game which throws two random numbers between 0 and 10 and asks the player what the answer would be if the two values were multiplied together. If the answer entered by the player is incorrect, the console alerts the player that the answer is incorrect and asks the question again. If the answer is correct, the console alerts the player that the answer is correct and displays another question.
